GUI (Graphical User Interface) application to plot well profile and perform the directional surveying.
This GUI application can plot the well profile in 2D as well as in 3D with the help of given input.
Also plots the change in the trajectory of the well.
Based on user input coordinates, the least measured depth profile is chosen from 5 well profiles for optimal drilling economics.
Based on coordinates and Well-log data, it will plot and analyze well logs, identifying lithology by creating depth-based layers.
